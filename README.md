# Case-Study-On-Optimizing-Cloud-Network-Infrastructure-for-Cost-Efficiency-and-Scalability
 This project focuses on enhancing cloud infrastructure through cost-saving and scalable solutions like auto-scaling, load balancing, and AI-driven 
monitoring. By implementing dynamic scaling and multi-cloud strategies, it improves resource efficiency and resilience for cloud-based systems.

 The project optimized cloud infrastructure by using dynamic auto-scaling, efficient load balancing, and AI-driven resource monitoring, reducing 
costs and enhancing scalability and performance during varying traffic conditions.
